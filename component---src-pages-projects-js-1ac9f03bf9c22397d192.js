Pain points in writing property-based tests include implementing diverse random input generators and thinking of meaningful properties to test. Developers, however, are more amenable to writing documentation; plenty of library API documentation is available and can be used as natural language specifications for property-based tests. As large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in a variety of coding tasks, we explore the potential of using LLMs to synthesize property-based tests. We call our approach Proptest AI, and propose three different strategies of prompting the LLM for PBT. We characterize various failure modes of Proptest AI and detail an evaluation methodology for automatically synthesized property-based tests.

We conduct an empirical study to show that over 60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries pin their dependencies to outdated versions, some over a year old. Furthermore, these pinned versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that upgrading dependencies to the latest minor or patch version is 3.45x as likely to reduce security vulnerabilities rather than introduce new ones. We propose Unpin, a novel tool that computes a confidence score for a dependency upgrade by leveraging crowdsourced tests of peer projects and simulating the upgrade for them. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular libraries in Maven shows that Unpin (with a minimum confidence score of 5) can provide confidence to over 3,000 consumers to safely perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities.")),r.a.createElement(l,{img:m.a,alt:"Mu2",title:"Guiding Greybox Fuzzing with Mutation Testing",link:"/pdfs/mu2-issta23.pdf",authors:"Vasudev Vikram, Isabella Laybourn, Ao Li, Nicole Nair, Kelton OBrien, Rafaello Sanna, Rohan Padhye",event:"ISSTA 2023 (Distinguished Paper Award)"},r.a.createElement("p",{className:"project-summary"},"In this paper, we develop and evaluate Mu2, a Java-based framework for incorporating mutation analysis in the greybox fuzzing loop, with the goal of producing a test-input corpus with a high mutation score.

This paper describes several dynamic optimizations implemented in Mu2 to overcome the high cost of performing mutation analysis with every fuzzer-generated input. These optimizations introduce trade-offs in fuzzing throughput and mutation killing ability, which we evaluate empirically on five real-world Java benchmarks.
