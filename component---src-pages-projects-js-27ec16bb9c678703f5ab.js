Mu2 makes use of a differential oracle for identifying inputs that exercise interesting program behavior without causing crashes. This paper describes several dynamic optimizations implemented in Mu2 to overcome the high cost of performing mutation analysis with every fuzzer-generated input. These optimizations introduce trade-offs in fuzzing throughput and mutation killing ability, which we evaluate empirically on five real-world Java benchmarks. Overall, variants of Mu2 are able to synthesize test-input corpora with a higher mutation score than state-of-the-art Java fuzzer Zest.")),i.a.createElement(l,{img:p.a,alt:"Bonsai Graph",title:"Growing a Test Corpus with Bonsai Fuzzing",link:"/pdfs/bonsai-icse21.pdf",authors:"Vasudev Vikram, Rohan Padhye, Koushik Sen",event:"ICSE 2021"},i.a.createElement("p",{className:"project-summary"},"  This paper presents a coverage-guided grammar based fuzzing technique for automatically generating a corpus of concise test inputs for programs such as compilers.

Our key insight is that instead of attempting to minimize convoluted fuzzer-generated test inputs, we can instead grow concise test inputs by construction using a form of iterative deepening.
